              University of Central Asia (UCA) is a private, not-for-profit, secular university, and was founded in 2000 through an International Treaty signed by the Presidents of Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Kazakhstan, and His Highness the Aga Khan, ratified by their respective parliaments and registered with the United Nations.<br>

              <br>The mission of UCA is to promote the social and economic development of Central Asia, particularly its mountain communities, by offering an internationally recognized standard of higher education and enabling the peoples of the region to preserve their rich cultural heritage as assets for the future.<br>
              
              <br>UCA has engaged in research since its inception in the following areas: economic and social policy, natural resource management, natural hazards and climate change, civil society development in Kyrgyz Republic, preservation, and promotion of the cultural heritage of Central Asia.<br>

              <br>UCA's undergraduate program extends across two campuses in Naryn, Kyrgyz Republic, and Khorog, Tajikistan, near the Tien Shan and Pamir mountains. In response to the needs of rural mountain communities, UCA has established its two campuses away from major urban centers. They are on the historic Silk Road, and UCA hopes to be at the heart of the economic and intellectual transformation taking place in the region. UCA offers four undergraduate disciplines: Communications and Media, Computer Science, Global Economics as well as Earth and Environmental Sciences.<br>
              
              <br>Computer Science Department at UCA combines the mathematical building blocks of theoretical knowledge with applied programming skills. The concepts of hardware and computer architecture are provided in addition to advanced software topics to create a comprehensive preparation for students to enter the world of technology, start their own business, or pursue study at a higher level. Alongside Computer Science coursework, practical projects are assigned in various courses to provide the capability of dealing with unanticipated problems and to share their findings in refereed journals. The programme, taught by experienced and renowned faculty, will equip students to be part of the region’s new generation of tech specialists who will develop infrastructure, generate entrepreneurial opportunities, energize the economy and create a new vision for the future.<br>
