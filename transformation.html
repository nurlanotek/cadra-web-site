                Over the last 30 years, Kyrgyzstan has experienced a fundamental transformation that changed all spheres of economic and social activity. Independence was accompanied by the dismantling of old ideology and the seeking of a new paradigm, creating the basis for the development of a modern, dynamic and successful society and new civic identity. Along the way, Kyrgyzstan, like all other parts of the world, has been going through rapid digitalization - the process of integration of digital technologies into everyday life.<br>                
                <br>The term "digital transformation of the Kyrgyz Republic" used by local public authorities means development of digital government, including parliament, where digital platforms are established by default with focus of digital services on mobile devices.  <br>
                <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kyrgyzstan’s vision according to the National Development Strategy 2018-2040:</span><br>
                <br>Kyrgyzstan is a smart country of a developed information society formed based on innovation and knowledge, effective, transparent and accountable government without corruption, with extensive own digital content and active participation of citizens of the country as users of digital technologies and services. Digitization of the economy and widespread use of innovative and advanced technologies stimulate growth of competitiveness, well-being and public security in the country.

                    As a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), Kyrgyzstan accepted the 'Digital Agenda 2025', a medium-term strategic document defining the goals, principles, tasks, directions and mechanisms of cooperation of the EAEU member states on the implementation of the EAEU digital agenda. The main purposes of Digital Agenda are: <br>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 2%;">
                        <li><i class='bx bx-check-circle'></i>accelerated transition of economies to a new technological way </li>
                        <li><i class='bx bx-check-circle'></i>high-quality and sustainable economic growth </li>

                    </ul>
                    Besides this, each county has own national digital transformation program. Thus, Kyrgyzstan has 'The Concept of Digital Transformation "Digital Kyrgyzstan 2019-2023” which was accepted in 2019. The Concept determines structure of transformation, management system and basic processes of country's digitalization. Moreover, the Concept determines the main sectors of economy where digital transformation is more than preferable: agriculture, light industry, tourism and creative economy.  <br>
                    <br>In addition, the country has the National Program of Digital Transformation on creation of open, transparent, technology intensive community at the level of each citizen, competitive business, stable government and reliable international relations named ‘Taza Koom' (which means "Clean Community" in the Kyrgyz language). 'Taza Koom' is a key component of the “2040 Sustainable Development Strategy”. ‘Taza Koom’ should assist in activating of transition into digital economy, and creating mobile and flexible state, with modernization of key social spheres of the country (education, health, ecology), economic (energy, agriculture, industry, services) and political (corruption prevention, fair elections). ‘Taza Koom’ should assist in achievement of all17 Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) and related to them tasks. <br>
                    <br>Discussions about digital transformation go together with discussions about cyber security. Many countries admit the necessity to make their economies secure and strong from assaults including hacker attacks. Kyrgyzstan accepted 'The Strategy of Cyber Security of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2019-2023'. The Strategy includes definitions of cyber security and related topics, descriptions of the main targets and functions, touches upon international cooperation and technical standardization and depicts expected outcomes from its realization as well as its monitoring. <br>
                    <br>On 21 April 2021, the President Sadyr Japarov signed the Decree “On further measures of digital transformation of the Kyrgyz Republic”. The main objectives are to create favorable conditions for digital transformation, the application of innovative approaches to the regulation of public relations, the widespread use of information and communication technologies in management and ensuring cybersecurity; implementation of national projects and programs on digital development and the digital economy, a single digital platform, as well as the creation of a sustainable mechanism for the development of digitalization, digital transformation, building a digital economy in Kyrgyzstan, the transition to a new technological order in all spheres of life, the implementation of national projects and programs for digital development. The Supervisory Board for Digitalization Issues under the President of the Kyrgyz Republic was formed, and the Regulations on the Supervisory Board were approved as part of this initiative.   <br>
                    <br>On April 25, 2022, the Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Kyrgyz Republic Akylbek Zhaparov approved the Concept for the Development of the Creative Economy in the Kyrgyz Republic for 2022–2026. The purpose of the Creative Economy Development Concept is to increase the contribution of creative industries to the domestic economy through the formation of a comprehensive state policy. Through the monetization of innovative ideas and developments that can be scaled up in industrial volumes, the creative industries sector in the country will become an accelerator of entrepreneurial activity with high added value and high economic effect, rationalize capital investments, expand export opportunities and provide employment growth. The creative economy in the future should become an impetus to stimulate innovation, increase investment attractiveness and reduce the dependence of the national economy on the mining industry and migrant remittances, and also contribute to the revival of the cultural heritage and self-identification of the state in the context of globalization. <br>

                                <br>The State Communications Agency at SCITC is officially a separate legal entity with own seal and director who is appointed by the Prime Minister on the proposal of the Chairman of SCITC. The State Communications Agency is the independent telecommunications sector regulator, and continues to perform the telecommunications licensing, monitoring, and analytics functions to guide and support national Internet development efforts.  <br>

                    <br><strong>The wireless market is fully competitive and currently consists of three major mobile operators.</strong> Mobile operators include Megacom, Beeline and Nur Telecom, which have developed mature 2G, 3G and 4G mobile infrastructure and services in the Kyrgyz Republic.  <br>
                    <br>According to the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic, 99 per cent of Kyrgyzstanis are covered with mobile networks, and 70 per cent have access to high quality 4G internet. 62.8 per cent of people aged 15 and older use the worldwide web. <br>
                    <br><strong>Kyrgyz Republic’s primary international connectivity consists of four links to Kazakhstan (including connectivity constructed in a tunnel under the Chu River) and two to China.</strong>  Connections to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan also exist but are not widely used to accommodate Kyrgyz demand for bandwidth, in part because of the high cost of bandwidth in those countries compared to transit purchased via Kazakhstan. Sources indicated that at the present time, the Kyrgyztelecom link to China is intended primarily for providing transit capacity to Tajikistan. <br>
                    <br><strong>At present, the government of the Kyrgyz Republic lacks sufficient human resources, institutions, policies and adequate IT infrastructure to deploy high quality digital services in a secure, reliable and cost effective manner.  </strong><br>
                    <br>The limited number of digital services that have been developed are typically isolated and expensive to build, maintain and secure. While these deficits represent a significant challenge, the advantage is that the relative lack of investment in outdated, legacy infrastructure and digital services offerings presents an opportunity to leapfrog to the latest technology and to learn from global experience by adopting best practice institutional structures and policies. <br>
                    <br><strong>Low basic ICT literacy rates have been identified as one of the key barriers to the greater use of ICTs by citizens and the private sector.</strong>his is hindering their participation in the digital economy and constraining their ability to access digital services. The lack of more advanced ICT skills, and an insufficient number of certified computer engineers and IT professionals, is also a constraint to sector growth and innovation. The rapid growth of new technologies and business models, demographic shifts, and economic trends are likely to have significant global impacts. Such effects will necessarily cause stresses in labor markets as existing jobs change, evolve and in some cases disappear. Advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, autonomous/semi-autonomous vehicles are a few examples of disruptive technologies that are gaining momentum. Countries in preparing for the future will, therefore, need to pursue agile strategies for rapidly aligning skills to fast changing demand in labor markets.

                    <br>Aiming to foster digital development and implementation of digital government, the Government of Kyrgyz Republic expressed its interest in participating in the Digital CASA project. The Digital CASA project is focused on improving Kyrgyzstan’s international connectivity, upgrading fiber optic networks within the country, and developing enabling digital platforms and solutions. They in turn, will help enhance government efficiency and transparency and quality of public services, and facilitate digital entrepreneurship and business through expanded availability of digital infrastructure and services. <br>
                    <br>The program was approved under the governmental project “Taza Koom” in February 2018. Back then, the first protocol on the funding agreement was signed by the International Development Association (IDA) that is in the group of the World Bank and the Kyrgyz Republic. The amount of aid was 50 million dollars, and 25 million was the interest-free loan with a fee 0.75 per cent per annum.  <br>
